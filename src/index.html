								<p>Theoretically wearable textiles that combine computing with aesthetics can be thought of as cognitive tools
									(Jonassen, 2000) that enhance the learning process and allow students to creatively explore computer
									programming, mechanical and textile design, problem solving and collaboration and can as presented in
									open-ended problems that require integrative thinking. The theoretical basis of the using wearable textiles
									which includes the design, development, and building of computer-based electronic artifacts that can be worn
									is firmly situated in the constructivism theory of learning (Piaget, 1972) whereby children's new knowledge is
									actively constructed from the world around them through experiential practice and independent/guided research
									to integrate new knowledge and arrive at deeper understanding.</p>

									If you've ever wondered how wearable technology like the FitBit or the Apple Watch work, this year's NYSD
									challenge is for you! Called Incredible Wearables, the challenge will have you and a group of your friends
									working together as an engineering team to build a functioning health monitor using a small computer and low
									cost sensors. With the help of volunteers and educators from the nation's 110 land-grant colleges and
									universities, not only will you build the monitor, but you'll also be able to analyze the information you
									gather on a computer, tablet or mobile phone. What kinds of careers could you do where a health monitor might
									help you with your job?

								<p>The maker movement, which combines learning communities with physical community workspaces called
									Makerspaces, has gained momentum in recent years through school and community events like Maker Faires
									(Hlubinka, et al., 2013). The physical makerspace is an important gathering point for tools, projects,
									mentors/experts that enables a rich learning environment. However, the point of making is not just to have an
									abundance of tools in one space; rather, it is about helping participants create personally meaningful
									projects with the periodic help of mentors, experts, and peers in ad-hoc learning communities. The makerspace
									movement has been successful in large diverse community centers with ample population bases and local
									expertise. Currently there exists many high-quality making programs in metropolitan areas across the United
									States. However, geographic distance in rural states like Nebraska is one of the largest barriers to student
									participation in Makerspaces, and this issue is compounded further by a general lack of mentors in these areas
									who have the skills necessary to lead and guide communities of learners (Barniskis, 2014). Rural communities
									often struggle with digital equity issues and e-connectivity issues that causes them to be left behind in
									technology-related economic and educational areas (Townsend, Sathiaseelan, Fairhurst, & Wallace, 2013). Rural
									populations remain isolated from the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) resources
									available in more urban, industrialized regions of the country. Contributing to these inequities is the lack
									of accessibility to advanced-technology businesses and higher education institutions which isolate youth and
									declining tax bases in once agriculturally rich communities (Petrin, Schafft, & Meece, 2014). </p>
