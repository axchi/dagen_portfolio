					<h4>4-H National Youth Science Day - Incredible Wearables</h4>
					<p>If you’ve ever wondered how wearable technology like the FitBit or the Apple Watch work, this year’s NYSD
						challenge is for you! Called Incredible Wearables, the challenge will have you and a group of your friends
						working together as an engineering team to build a functioning health monitor using a small computer and low cost
						sensors. With the help of volunteers and educators from the nation’s 110 land-grant colleges and universities,
						not only will you build the monitor, but you’ll also be able to analyze the information you gather on a computer,
						tablet or mobile phone. What kinds of careers could you do where a health monitor might help you with your job?</p>
